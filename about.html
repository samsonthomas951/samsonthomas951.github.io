        <h2>Samson Thomas | Software Engineer & AI Enthusiast</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>I am a highly motivated and results-oriented software engineer with a deep passion for artificial intelligence. I have a strong foundation in computer science fundamentals and a proven track record of developing innovative and efficient software solutions.</p>

        <p>My journey in the world of technology began at a young age, fueled by a fascination with how things work and a desire to create something new. This curiosity led me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering at Zetech University, where I honed my skills in programming, algorithms, data structures, and software design.</p>

        <p>During my studies, I developed a particular interest in artificial intelligence and its potential to revolutionize various industries. I actively participated in workshops and regional robotics competitions, which provided me with valuable hands-on experience in computer vision and AI basics.</p>

        <p>After graduating, I furthered my knowledge and expertise by completing a Certificate in Software Development at Modcom. This program exposed me to a wider range of programming languages and technologies, including Kotlin, JavaScript, Python, and machine learning. It was at Modcom that my passion for deep neural networks truly blossomed.</p>

        <h2>Notable Projects</h2>
        <hr>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>SMS ZERAKI:</strong> An Android app that uses SMS to retrieve student results, addressing challenges faced with traditional systems.</li>
            <li><strong>CUSTOM MADE OBS PLUGIN:</strong> A plugin for OBS that displays ScaledML hymnal lyrics during live streams.</li>
            <li><strong>CLASS ROOM:</strong> A Django chat application with a student result management system, utilizing web sockets and JavaScript.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I am constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow as a software engineer. I am particularly interested in exploring the applications of deep neural networks in various domains, such as natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics.</p>

        <p>Beyond technical skills, I am a strong communicator, team player, and problem-solver. I am also highly adaptable and eager to learn new technologies and methodologies.</p>

        <p>I am excited to see what the future holds and to contribute my skills and passion to the ever-evolving world of software engineering and artificial intelligence.</p>

        <p>Please feel free to connect with me on social media or reach out via email if you have any questions or would like to collaborate.</p>
